Ng-template
is a template element that Angular uses with structural. These template elements only work in the presence of structural directives, which help us to define a template that doesn’t render anything by itself, but conditionally renders them to the DOM.
 

Ng-container
ng-container is a simple directive that allows you to group elements in a template that doesn’t interfere with styles or layout because
The ng-container does not render in the DOM, but content inside it is rendered
This is helpful if you don’t want any extra div on DOM, you can simply use ng-container. Like use ng-if and ng-for at the same time.
